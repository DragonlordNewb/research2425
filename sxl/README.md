# SXL: the Spacetime Exploration Library

This library, written during the '24/'25 research cycle, is intended to allow the modeling, analysis, and simulation of complex spacetime geometries so that the kinetmatics of the LVFD warp drive can be better understood and the prototype warp drives optimized.
